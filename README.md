# Tic-tac-toe-TOP

Tic-tac-toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid, one with Xs and the other with Os. A player wins when they mark all three spaces of a row, column, or diagonal of the grid, while they traditionally draw a line through those three marks to indicate the win.

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum, it serves as practice to learn how to make a tic-tac-toe game.
